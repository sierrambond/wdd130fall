            <p>Hello, I am a senior graduating in Spring of 2025 and I am studying accounting. 
                I'm mostly done with all my major classes, so now I'm just doing classes in my cluster 
                and certificate.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like hanging out with my friends and roommates, playing pickleball, 
                caring for my plants, and just being around people that give off great energy.</p>
            <p>My favorite scripture is Luke 1:37 which reads "For with God nothing shall be impossible." 
                I like this scripture because it's a good reminder that when we are going through trials
                and they seem harder than we've ever dealt with before, God is there for us and won't let
                us go through it alone.</p>
